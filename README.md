### I. Executive Summary

The first step in solving any data analysis problem is <b>Data Collection</b>. It can be done through various forms and sources. In this project, it will be collected through <b>Web Scraping</b> and <b>Web APIs</b>.

Sources including:
    * Surveys
    * Job Postings
    * Training portals

Data collected from the web is often if not, almost always raw and unclean. So, the data need to be prepared for the analysis.

Achieving this will be using <b>Data Wrangling Techniques</b>; which means that the data needs to be consistent, and without missing values and errors.

After finishing up with the data cleaning, next comes the application of statistical techniques to <b>analyze the data</b>, and identify insights and trends. Posing questions are important in order to find accurate solutions, and these questions are:
    * What are the top programming languages in demand?
    * What are the top database skills in demand?
    * What are the highest paying programming jobs?

Consequently, the findings will be put together through creating a <b>Data Visualization</b> utilizing the IBM Cognos Analystics to build an interactive dashboard.

Finally, the presention through storytelling using a written report or as a presentation.

### II. Introduction ( Scenario )

A new hire as a Data Analyst by a global IT, and business consulting services firm, need to identify future skill requirements in order to keep pace with the constantly changing technologies and remain competitive.

The principle of the project is to answer one key question - <b> What are the current skill requirement in technology field</b>

After going through the whole process of analysing data, the result will inform the consulting firm of the key technical skills needed at the moment so the firm can focus on putting effort and resource into developing valuable technology assets. This is essential in the success of a business because, it's only possible to understand the market's needs through knowing the current trends, otherwise, the firm might slowly slide into obscurity, as well as it will cost tons of money if the firm works in the wrong direction.

As well as it may help new graduates or any person interested building a career based on the current industries' trends.
